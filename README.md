# Project Overview

# Here is the main questions you are trying to solve while working on this case study:

## 1. Which borough of London has seen the greatest average increase in housing prices over the (approximately) two decades covered by the dataset? 

From 1998 to 2018 the London borough of Hackney had the greatest increase in average home prices at 6.198%.

## 2. What were the main challenges you encountered? How did you overcome them? What could you not overcome?

The biggest issue was cleaning the data to make sense of what we were working with. The excel format needed to be changed, and some of the values were irrelevant to the majority of the data.

## 3. Is there anything youâ€™d like to investigate deeper?

 a. Which top 5 London Boroughs had the least amount of increase in average home prices over the 20 year time span.

b. What Borough had the most fluctuation in prices during that time.
